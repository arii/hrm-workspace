Create a Workspace Environment


Create Dev Container for hrm-workspace:

Define a basic Python/Shell environment in devcontainer.json and a Dockerfile (or use a simple python:latest image with necessary dependencies like poetry, requests, github-api-package).

This is the ideal place to install dependencies required by your Python/Agentic scripts.
